## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Phishing is the biggest security challenge that end users face in crypto, period. We are in desperate need for *crypto centric* solutions to our security issues in the space and phishing is no different. From fake Vitalik giveaways on Twitter to phishing streams from the EF on youtube to good old fashioned phishing emails, we have a challenge on our hands when it comes to keeping our users safe. Users need to know:

1. That when they interact with websites, social media accounts, social media posts, that they are in fact interacting with the person(s) they think they are (authenticity).

2. That as far as is possible, they are not interacting with malicious content online.

NightHawk addresses both of these problems using a clean UI and UX for the end user.

Phishing is far more than just a security threat to the ecosystem. It's regularly cited by both newcomers and experienced users as one of their biggest fears and hurdles to adoption in the space. Phishing is *a hurdle to adoption*. We put forward this project as a positive step towards keeping users safe online in our industry.

### Overview

Nighthawk is a free anti-phishing browser extension offering safe browsing in the web3 field.

The plugin is 100% open source, privacy focused and does nothing to store users browsing history or anything else privacy compromising on our servers. It is almost completely serverless with all activity happening in the browser for the user.

It's widely known that the crypto space, including the Polkadot community, is consistently under the threat of scams. While quantifying the exact losses is challenging, phishing attacks have resulted in the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars across the crypto ecosystem. PhishFort is embarking on a significant initiative by creating a consumer-oriented, community-driven, free, and efficient solution to combat this problem. While our primary business involves providing B2B services to various industry communities, this project is our way of giving back to the entire crypto industry without commercial interests.

Our motivation to undertake this endeavour stems from our deep understanding of the crypto landscape and the severe damage inflicted by phishing attacks in a matter of minutes. What has been missing in this fight against phishing is a swift response mechanism driven by the community. Although we take pride in promptly removing malicious content from the internet, we recognise the need to offer real-time protection to end users if we are to collectively address this problem. Nighthawk has been designed to serve this exact purpose.

For too long, end users have been easy prey for scammers, but we aim to change this dynamic. By allowing users to report scams and disseminate these reports to the entire user-base for near real-time protection, we aspire to transform potential victims into proactive responders.

The stack is mostly TypeScript based, with React for most front end components and GCP cloud provider to facilitate the sharing of threat intel with the extension.

We have a highly ambitious goal with our next phase of Nighthawk. We plan to create a first of its kind LLM powered, real time, zero day phishing protection engine. The details for this are outlined in more detail below.

Here are three stages to this:

1. Heuristic engine development.

2. Rule generation and integrating submitting rules suggested by the community.

3. LLM based rule generation.

#### Stage 1 : heuristic engine development

- There are a number of basic heuristic rules that can be used to detect phishing.

- Rules allow the blocking of URLs which have not yet been discovered anywhere else, and are not present in blocklists anywhere in the world.

- Consider for example, if the title of a Talisman phishing website is the same as the legitimate website, but it is hosted on a different domain. This may indicate phishing. Writing a rule for a heuristic engine that checked the page title, presence of a logo, and current domain on a website would likely be effective at protecting against certain kinds of phishing attacks that copied the Talisman page verbatim.

- Another example of a heuristic rule might be to verify whether the CSS of a given website that a NightHawk user is interacting with has tried to copy the look and feel of Talisman. This may indicate phishing.

- With a combination of the right rules, these simple but effective heuristic checks become highly effective means of protecting an end user against phishing. The heuristic engine relies on practical rules of common-sense strategies, allowing for quick decision-making and can evolve efficiently to meet new kits, actors, and threats as they arise.

- Architecting both the heuristic engine as well as the structure and make up of the rules is a crucial first step in the plan toward zero day phishing prevention. These rules fuel the engine and apply practical strategies.

#### Stage 2 : Rule generation and integrating submitting rules suggested by the community

- After creating the initial subset of rules, the key theme of this next milestone is around opening up this process to the community at large. By leveraging ambassadors in the community, we greatly enhance our reach and the breadth of the rules Nighthawk users are protected by.

- Create an interface for community rule-submitting to allow the community to submit rules.

- Testing of the usersâ€™ submitted rules for false positives and giving automated feedback on the rule. This is important, as while rules are powerful and have great potential to curb phishing, a poorly written or untested rule might have intended consequences, such as flagging a legitimate website as phishing to the end user.

- Expand the ruleset crafted by the team and integrate rules suggested by the community that work at flagging new kits/scams.

- Explore and organize subsets of data to facilitate the process of training the model.

#### Stage 3 : LLM based rule generation[This is where the magic happens ðŸª„]

 - Rules submitted by the community as well as rules crafted by our team internally are a good starting point, however, these are limited by the response time between a human finding a scam or new kit, and writing the corresponding rule that would block this site in the plugin. This gap in the time between detection and the time to alert potential victims who may be visiting the website can be costly and highly damaging in phishing, where every minute counts.

- We propose an automated pipeline for automatically generating rules in real time. When a scam is reported or submitted, we aim to have an LLM generate a corresponding rule that would protect the user from visiting the site. This could be automatically tested, tuned, adapted, before being deployed across the Nighthawk ecosystem in real time. Configuring a LLM is essential to tailor its behavior to our specific needs, which allows adapting the model to unique tasks, enhancing its relevance and performance.

- We intend to train/fine-tune LLM for specific tasks that can result in the generation of rules for phishing kits that remain undetected by existing methods or individuals. Given how fast the LLM space is iterating, it is difficult to outline which of the RAG/FT/PEFT techniques and on which model will be most relevant, but it will likely require the adaptation of a model in some way in order to perform accurately.

- We believe that this will be a first of its kind in the world, and not just in the Crypto industry. Leveraging language models to provide anti-phishing protection on the fly to a high risk community, while remaining fully open source and private.

### Ecosystem Fit

We want Nighthawk to be an absolute no-brainer for every single crypto user in the world. Noone is immune to the damage that phishing causes, from seasoned crypto veterans to newcomers who are still learning the ropes. We believe that the polkadot community as a whole will be a fantastic fit with high engagement levels, vulnerable users and a desire from the community leaders within the ecosystem to combat this problem.

There are some current answers to this problem on the market, most notably EAL by the crime fighting superstar Harry Denley. While we not only endorse but financially contribute to community initiatives that combat phishing in the industry, PhishFort has become one of if not the major anti-phishing provider in the space. This means that the all important _backend_ infrastructure - a constantly updated feed of newly discovered attacks, a team of trained and professional anti-phishing analysts, and experience being in the trenches daily fighting this problem as a company are needed to bolster a community facing solution to this problem.

There are some other commercial solutions to this problem which both charge money, and are structured in such a way as to compromise the fundamental privacy of a users browsing experience. We personally have a strong aversion to compromises on user privacy and although we understand the need to charge for such a plugin, prefer answers to this problem that are transparent and accessible to anyone, anywhere in the world irrespective of their ability to afford such a solution.
